# levelsBot 1.1

A Discord bot written in Python 3.5.2, that allows you to give users stars (or levels). The bot requires discord.py module to run.

Features in Early Testing (working features, but still in development):

- Add command to view the entire list of stars for a server (currently spams the user with message notifications on large servers)
- Changing peoples nicknames with their star count in brackets (currently only works with default usernames, not nicknames)

Features Coming Soon (features closer to the top will be worked on first):

- Change print statements to include users name and discriminator not ID
- Add support for multiple servers (multiple txt files and python files)
