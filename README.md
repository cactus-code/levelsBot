# levelsBot 1.0

A Discord bot written in Python 3.5.2, that allows you to give users stars (or levels).

Features Coming Soon:

- Changing peoples nicknames with their star count in brackets (this could get a bit ridiculous with large star counts)
- Add command to view the entire list of stars for a server
